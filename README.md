# Visualising Data

Around 2011 I was really interested in visualising data (still am). All material in this folder is from that epoche. I even came across some funky Rcmdr instructions... 

Most material I deleted, but I kept some old notes, mostly due to nostalgia.

Folders:
- `portfolio` contains graphs I created. 
- `presentations` contains two presentations I gave on this topic
- `material` the funky instructions video I mentioned above.
